## Project Description
Welcome to one of the first of its kind. A first version of an AI Music Synthesizer using Facebook's MusicGen. The idea is to further develop and train it to fine tune it into becoming an Electronic Music Synthesizer. Its a webapp with a login using auth0. Once to authenticate you'll gain access to the synth where you'll introduce a prompt, select a length in seconds, and get back a wav file to listen to. If its correct you'll be able to download and start again.

The Web-app consists of a Front-end in React which interacts with a Node Back-end sending it its requests. The back-end in turn inferences  a music-gen model in Replicate which then sends back a link to a wav file as output.
